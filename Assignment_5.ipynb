During training with backpropagation, gradients are used to update the network's weights. In vanilla RNNs, these gradients can either vanish (become extremely small) or explode (grow exponentially) as they are propagated back through the network for long sequences.\n","\n","  - **Vanishing Gradients:** When gradients vanish, they become too small to effectively update the weights in the earlier layers of the network. This makes it difficult for the network to learn long-term dependencies within the sequence, hindering its ability to capture context and relationships between distant words.\n","  - **Exploding Gradients:** Conversely, exploding gradients can cause the weights to update drastically, leading to numerical instability and hindering the training process altogether.\n","2. **Short-term Memory:** Due to vanishing gradients, vanilla RNNs struggle to retain information from earlier parts of the sequence as the sequence lengthens. This effectively limits their memory to a short window, making it challenging to understand complex relationships and dependencies in longer sentences or paragraphs.\n","\n","3. **Limited Representational Power:** Vanilla RNNs may lack the representational capacity to capture the full complexity of natural language, especially when dealing with intricate syntactic structures or nuances in meaning. This can limit their ability to perform effectively in tasks like sentiment analysis or machine translation.\n","\n","4. **Difficulty with Variable Length Inputs:** Vanilla RNNs typically require fixed-length inputs.
