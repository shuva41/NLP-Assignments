        "One-hot encoding is a technique used in machine learning, as well as in Deep Learning, to represent categorical variables as numerical features. It's particularly useful for situations where the order or relationship between categories doesn't matter, but the presence or absence of each category does.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Identify unique categories:** For each categorical variable in your data, find all the unique values it can take. Imagine you have a \"color\" variable with values \"red\", \"blue\", and \"green\".\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Create binary columns:** For each unique category, create a new binary column. These columns are called \"dummy variables\". In our color example, you'd have three new columns: \"color_red\", \"color_blue\", and \"color_green\".\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Assign values:** Now, for each data point, assign a 1 to the column corresponding to its category and 0s to all other columns. For example, a data point with \"color\" as \"red\" would have 1 in \"color_red\" and 0s in \"color_blue\" and \"color_green\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a table to illustrate:  \n",
        "\n",
        "| Datapoint | Color\t| Color_Red\t| Color_Blue | Color_Green |\n",
        "| --------- | ----- | --------- | ---------- | ----------- |\n",
        "| 1         | Red   | 1         | 0          | 0           |\n",
        "| 2         | Blue  | 0         | 1          | 0           |\n",
        "| 3         | Green | 0         | 0          | 1           |\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefits of one-hot encoding:**  \n",
        "1. **Compatible with models:** Many machine learning models require numerical input, and one-hot encoding allows you to use categorical variables with these models.\n",
        "2. **Avoids ordinality issues:** Some categorical variables might have an implicit order (e.g., small, medium, large). One-hot encoding treats all categories equally, avoiding misinterpretations by the model.\n",
        "3. **Provides clear information:** Each binary column explicitly represents the presence or absence of a category, making it easier for the model to understand the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Things to consider:**\n",
        "1. **Dimensionality increase:** Each category creates a new column, potentially increasing the size of your data. This can be problematic for large datasets or models sensitive to high dimensionality.\n",
        "2. **Sparsity:** Many values in the encoded data will be zeros, leading to sparse matrices. This can be inefficient for some algorithms.\n",
        "3. **Not suitable for all situations:** If categories have a natural order or relationships, other encoding techniques might be more appropriate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, one-hot encoding is a versatile and widely used technique for dealing with categorical data in machine learning."

        "1. **Define N:**\n",

It's a widely used technique in natural language processing (NLP) to evaluate the importance of a word to a document within a collection of documents. It helps identify keywords that are important for a specific document but not generally used across all documents.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Term Frequency (TF):**\n",

        "2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):**\n",
        "\n",

        "3. **Putting them together:**\n",

        "  - The TF-IDF score is calculated by multiplying the TF score by the IDF score. - This gives a final score that reflects both how important a word is to a specific document and how rare it is overall.\n",
        "  - Words with high TF-IDF scores are considered more important for that document because they are both frequent within that document and not very common across the entire collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefits of TF-IDF:**\n",
        "- **Focuses on relevant keywords:** It helps identify words that are specifically relevant to the content of a document, rather than just common words.\n",

        "**Limitations of TF-IDF:**\n",
        "- **Doesn't consider word order or context:** It only factors in word frequency and rarity, not the meaning or relationships between words.\n",

It aims to capture both the statistical co-occurrence of words and semantic relationships between them.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Co-occurrence Matrix:** A large matrix is constructed, where each row and column represents a unique word in the vocabulary. Each cell value represents the co-occurrence count of the corresponding row and column words in the training corpus.\n",
        "2. **Ratio Calculation:** For each word pair, the ratio of co-occurrence probabilities is calculated across different contexts in the corpus. This ratio captures semantic similarities and differences between the words.\n",
        "3. **Factorization:** Matrix factorization techniques are used to decompose the co-occurrence matrix into low-dimensional word embedding vectors. These vectors aim to represent the semantic similarities and differences captured in the co-occurrence ratios.\n",
        "4. **Optimization:** The model is trained by minimizing the difference between the predicted and actual co-occurrence ratios, fine-tuning the word embedding vectors.\n",
