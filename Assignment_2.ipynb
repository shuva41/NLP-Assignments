For example, the sentence \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\" would be split into 9 tokens.\n","- **Character-level tokens:** Here, each individual character becomes a token. This is useful for capturing information like morphology (word structure) or dealing with languages that don't have clear word boundaries.\n","- **Subword tokens:** These are smaller units than words, typically generated by algorithms, and often capture morphemes (meaningful word parts) or combinations of characters.
